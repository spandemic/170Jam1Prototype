ARTG/CMPM 170 Game Jam 1 Individual Assignment

Prompt: One Button Game

Game Name: Achilles Wheel

Mechanics: Waves of good and bad cells rush towards the player. The player can control the wall protecting the nucleus by rotating the direction of the open side. Points are awarded if a good cell reaches the nucleus; however, Health is lost when bad cells reach the nucleus. The cells speed up over time until they reach a maximum speed, and the cell density increases over time with no limit. The player can also "delete" cells if they time the rotation correctly. Theoretically the player can stay alive forever by just spamming the button, but their score will not increase. Try to beat my high score!
